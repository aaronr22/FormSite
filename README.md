# Form Site

## Setup
Enter `git clone https://github.com/aaronr22/FormSite.git`


## TODO
- Add input fields(ONLY TEXT OR NUMERICAL) to index.ejs(ignore the .ejs ending pretend its .html) =>  `<input type='text' name='txt2'>`
  -   The `name` field must match what the field will look like on the excel sheet, `id` doesn't matter
- Add the field names to the excel file template
- Figure out naming convention
